  <p>The Gorakh hill station is situated 423 km (263 mi) from Karachi and nearly 8 hours' driving distance.[2] The Hill station attracts thousands of tourists from the city.</p>
  <p>The name Gorakh is derived from the Sindhi language in which, word "Gorakhnath" refers to a popular Hindu Saint associated with the deity Shiva and that Balochi-language word "Gurkh" is later dialectic adaptation of Sindhi-language word Gorakh.[4] but there is no connection of Persian Gurg and Balochi Gurkh means wolf with word of Sindh language. It is believed that the name is derived from original Word Gorakh either of Sanskrit or Sindhi language which means very difficult and intricate</p>

  <p>Mohenjo-daro (/moʊˌhɛndʒoʊ ˈdɑːroʊ/; Sindhi: موئن جو دڙو, meaning 'Mound of the Dead Men';[2][3] Urdu: موئن جو دڑو [muˑənⁱ dʑoˑ d̪əɽoˑ]) is an archaeological site in the province of Sindh, Pakistan. Built around 2500 BCE, it was the largest settlement of the ancient Indus Valley Civilisation, and one of the world's earliest major cities, contemporaneous with the civilizations of ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Minoan Crete, and Norte Chico. With an estimated population of at least 40,000 people, Mohenjo-daro prospered until around 1700 BCE.[4]

    Mohenjo-daro was abandoned in the 19th century BCE as the Indus Valley Civilization declined, and the site was not rediscovered until the 1920s. Significant excavation has since been conducted at the site of the city, which was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1980, the first site in South Asia to be so designated.[5] The site is currently threatened by erosion and improper restoration</p>

  <p>Keenjhar Lake (Sindhi: ڪینجھر ڍنڍ) commonly called Malik Lake (Urdu: کلری Malik,Sindhi: Maik ڍنڍ) is located in Thatta District of Sindh the province of Pakistan. It is situated about 36 kilometres (22 mi) from the city of Thatta.[3] It is the largest fresh water lake in Pakistan and an important source of drinking water for Thatta District and Karachi city.[4] Through the construction of a bund on the eastern side, it is said that the lake was formed by the union of two lakes: Sonehri and Keenjhar.[1]

    Keenjhar Lake has been declared a ramsar site and a wildlife sanctuary. It provides a favorable habitat of winter migratory birds like ducks, geese, flamingos, cormorants, waders, herons, egrets, ibises, terns, coots and gulls. It has been observed as a breeding area of the black-crowned night heron, the cotton pygmy goose, purple swamphen, and pheasant-tailed jacana.[5]
    
    Keenjhar Lake is a popular tourist resort. Many people from Karachi, Hyderabad and Thatta visit to enjoy picnics, swimming, fishing, and boating.

The Shah Jahan Mosque (Urdu: شاہ جہاں مسجد, Sindhi: مسجد شاهجهاني،, Persian: مسجد شاه‌جهان), also known as the Jamia Masjid of Thatta (Urdu: جامع مسجد ٹھٹہ, Sindhi: شاھجھاني مسجد ٺٽو), is a 17th-century building that serves as the central mosque for the city of Thatta, in the Pakistani province of Sindh. The mosque is considered to have the most elaborate display of tile work in South Asia,[1][2] and is also notable for its geometric brick work - a decorative element that is unusual for Mughal-period mosques.[3] It was built during the reign of Mughal emperor Shah Jahan, who bestowed it to the city as a token of gratitude,[1] and is heavily influenced by Central Asian architecture - a reflection of Shah Jahan's campaigns near Samarkand shortly before the mosque was designed</p>
